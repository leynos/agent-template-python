# Generic Copier Template

This repository provides a [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) template for a Python package.
It offers two flavours:

1. **Python Only** – a pure Python implementation.
2. **Python with Rust** – includes a PyO3 extension.

Run `copier copy` and answer the prompts to generate a project.
