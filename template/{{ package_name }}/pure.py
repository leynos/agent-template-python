This module contains the Python implementation exported by the package
entrypoint in `__init__.py`.

When the optional Rust extension is built successfully, `__init__.py` prefers
the Rust-backed implementation and uses this module as the Python fallback for
environments where the extension is unavailable.

behind the package's public API.
